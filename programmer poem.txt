The gap we should be really worrying about

So many gaps are getting bigger by the day,
The gap between the rich and those that are not rich,
The gap between the famous and the infamous,
The gap between the generous and the not so generous,
The gap between the closed mouth and the open mouth,
The gap between the tree huger and the developer,
The gap between the lover and the hater,
The gap between the buyer and the seller,
The gap between the optimist and the pessimist, 
The gap between the helper and the shouter,
The gap between the soother and the shooter,
The gap between the honest and the dishonest,
The gap between the renter and those below the renter,
The gap between the media and the reader,
The gap between the leaders and the bleeders,
The gap between the real and the unreal,
The gap between the inventor and those who say what for,
The gap between those with power and those without power,
The gap between the grateful and the ungrateful,
Are all very worrying,
Without adding the gaps that we continue to be inventing.

But the gap we should be really worried about,
Is the gap between thinking and doing?
In a world that is dying,
To see more doing,
And less thinking about doing.
